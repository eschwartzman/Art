These are some programs I made in 2013 that output some art-like pictures

	Some examples include:
 
![Persian Rug](Rugcolor.png "Persian Rug")

![Julia](Fractal_Project_2_3.png "Julia")

![Triangles](TrianglesArt.png "Triangles")

These are just some of my favorite outputs

BouncingBalls produces just that, and flower produces a flower like image with many colors
